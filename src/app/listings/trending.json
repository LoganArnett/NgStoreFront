Bracelets on the wrist, of course, make our hands graceful. But, in my opinion, a bracelet, which is on your shoulder, can not be compared with anything! :)))\r\n\r\nThe bracelet is universal: in any fullness will look perfect. He does not press and pulls your hand. You go all day and not to think about it - it is so comfortable.\r\n\r\nHe came to you perfectly, tell how many centimeters (Inch) in girth your shoulder? Need to measure where the biceps.\r\n\r\n9 – 10  (inch) = 23 – 25 (см) \r\n10 ¼ - 11 (inch) = (26 – 28 см) \r\n11 ¼ - 12 ¼  (inch) = (29 – 31 см)\r\n12 ½ - 13 (inch) = (32 – 33 см)\r\n\r\nThe exact repetition of work is impossible: the leaves on the bracelet may differ slightly from those pictured.\r\n\r\nOver time, copper will darken slightly, but when you rub any dense tissue, brilliance will return. I love the pure metal, but if you want, I&#39;ll put a varnish, which will help keep the shine polishing.\r\n\r\nCopper has beneficial effects on human health. In the old days it was used for a long time to promote wound healing. This is due to the ability of copper to balance the polarity of the body, direct the flow of projective and receptive energy.\r\n\r\nGift wrapping is included.\r\n\r\nAfter sending, I&#39;ll provide the tracking number and you will be able to track all the movements of the parcel.\r\n\r\nOrder a set of necklace https://www.etsy.com/ru/listing/220814954/necklace-foliage-jewelry-jewelry-made-of?ref=shop_home_active_11",

Plastic bags are wonderful for protecting jewelry pieces. *Jewelry should only be put on after washing and applying any makeup, hair spray, gels, lotions or perfume. *Try to protect any jewelry from harsh chemicals, extreme temperatures and sunlight. *Always try to store your beaded necklaces or bracelets flat. *You should not wear beaded jewelry while doing household or outdoor chores. *You should never wear any jewelry when swimming or showering. The chlorine can cause damage. Please do not swim or shower with your beads. *Wipe with a damp cloth and if need be a little mild dish soap, but do not immerse. *Store your jewelry in a clean, dry place. *Jewelry should never be dipped or used in an ultrasonic cleaner. *Avoid dropping and hard contact (i.e., knocking against objects). *Put on jewelry last when",

Plant sizes can vary from:\r\n▲ 2 to 10 inches {5 to 25 cm} tall\r\n\r\nFaux Plants  - These are great for the black thumbs amongst us who still like the look of plants.

            "description": "This hat is a handcrafted imitation of headdress of native americans (war bonnet).\r\nUnlike the Indian headdresses from real feathers - knitted Roach is warm, original, fashionable winter hat for everyday use.\r\n\r\nThe idea came to me thanks to my friend who has long black hair what makes him look like an indian. He dresses very colorful and likes unusual things, so I decided to create winter hat for him, according to his appearance and identity. That is how indian shaman hat was chosen. After a month, spending in search of appropriate shape of feathers and weave, the work was done. Now it takes twice less time. The most appropriate word to express reaction of people about this hat is - stunned.\r\n\r\nWith that beanie you can order a scarf in same color as here https://www.etsy.com/ru/listing/216238774/teplyj-arf-eegrelka-arf-homut-snud? \r\n With this scarf, will be protected from cold not only head, but also neck. Moebius loop scarf could be used in many ways, some of them presented on foto.\r\n\r\nThe crochet beanie best fits an average adult and teen head. One size fits all!\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in purchase, but prefer different color or size, feel free to contact me and I will make a custom design only for you.\r\n\r\nHand wash in cold water with detergent or shampoo. Do not HANG the laundry out to dry, because it may provoke stretching. For avoiding stretching dry it in horizontal way.\r\n\r\nIt is made in my pet-free and smoke-free home.\r\n\r\nThis item are in stock and ready to be shipped!\r\n\r\nNOTE : Please read the shipping policies before purchasing.",

            "description": "Organic lavender & chai meet in a soap blend of organic oils containing 40% extra virgin organic olive oil. This is a vegan cold process soap, cured for at least 4 weeks! This soap is made with a blend of moisturizing organic & natural oils! Instead of water organic chai is used to create this unique soap created to be reminiscent of a winter tea delight. Organic lavender essential oil is lightly blended with spicy essential oils to create a warm bare scent.\n\nCold process soaps are high quality and long lasting. Cold process soaps have moisturizing benefits for skin and are better for the environment!\n\nPlease note each small batch is handmade & cut, there is natural variation between batches, they do not always appear as pictured. \n\nBecause Pure Naked Soaps are created with only 100% natural & organic essential oils, it is not possible to create certain scents without lab created fragrance oils. Essential oil soaps are significantly milder than those that contain fragrance oils.  These often contain harmful chemicals like Phthalates. Pure Naked Soaps are created for people who want to enjoy unique soaps without harmful chemicals!  No harmful fragrances, phthalates or sulfates are added. \n\nThis listing is for 1 bar of soap that is approx 4 oz.\n\nPlease store your bars on a soap dish or use a handy scrubby soap bag, these help keep your soaps dry so they will last longer!! \n\nIngredients: Saponified oils of organic olive, organic sustainable palm, organic sustainable palm kernel oil, organic castor, purple clay, organic chai tea & essential oils.",
